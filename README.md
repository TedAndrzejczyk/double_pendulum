# double_pendulum
- Run the run_gui module, this is the only module that needs to be run by the user
- Adjust the sliders to change the double pendulum parameters to your specifications
- The 'Reset' button returns the slider values to the defaults
- The 'Undo' button reverts the slider values to the values from when the simulation was last run
- The 'Run' button runs the program with the values the sliders are on when the button is pressed and causes a new window to pop up which is the output
- The output is one figure with the double pendulum simulation on the left subplot and an energy graph of the double pendulum on the right subplot
- You must close (only) the simulation window before running a new simulation, as noted at the top of the window
- Once the simulation window is closed after a run, you can change the slider values and run more simulations as many times as wanted
